		<b>SQRL</b> is a new authentication mechanism that does not require the server to
		keep any secret information (like passwords). It is secure, quick, and reliable, but
		<u>does require a special client program</u> in order for it to work.
		<br/><br/>
		When using an untrusted computer, SQRL can be used directly from your mobile device
		(by scanning the qr code) to minimize the risk of an account takeover, or directly
		from your personal workstation (by clicking on the qr code).
		<br/><br/>
	</right>
	<lower>
		It is not neccesary to create a new identity per-website, as the SQRL protocol
		automatically isolates your online identities per-domain.
		See <a href="https://www.grc.com/sqrl/sqrl.htm">the main sqrl page at grc.com</a>
		for more information.
		<br/><br/>
		If allowed by the server, one can also *create* a new account by trying to login
		by this mechanism.

	<b>Perfect Paper Passwords (PPP)</b> are a "something you have" authentication mechanism where you can
	provide a <b><u>very short</u></b> password from a pre-established set of response cards (which are
	about the size of a credit card and require no batteries) knowing that each password can be used
	(and will only be requested) once... <b>ever</b>. You can retire entire sheets en-masse if they are
	observed or fall out of your control. For more information, please see

	<b>NOTICE:</b> in a complete implementation, one cannot fully revoke a long-standing authentication method when logged
	in from a method of a <u>lower rank</u>; though it may be possible to <b>lock</b> your own account, until you
	can receive direct assistance.
	<br/><br/>
	<b>NOTICE:</b> a stronger security rank is not neccesarily better (or even feasible) for a particular application. For
	example, an air-gapped machine (or misconfigured router) cannot use SQRL authentication, and a stateless machine cannot
	use H-OTP authentication.
	<br/><br/>
	<b>NOTICE:</b> you are not required (or even encouraged) to use all these forms of authentication. While they are each
	deemed secure in their own right, there is greater security in <u>knowing</u> which authentication methods are active
	on your account (that an attacker might be foiled by using a method that will never succeed), or in the case of
	multi-factor authentication... which *combination* of methods must be used. Furthermore, if an issue is found in one
	authentication method, you might still be able to use this service.
	<br/><br/>
	<b>NOTICE:</b> for the purposes of this analysis, the commonly used "security questions" are equivalent to an additional
	password (when used as a 2nd factor) or an auxillary password (when usable to recover an account).
	<!--
	anyone in position of the device could press the button or
	read the number on it's display
	-->
	<br/><br/>
	<b>Recommendations:</b> In general, we reccomend using SQRL "with a backup", due to the newness of the SQRL protocol
	and possibility of account/data loss if not properly managed. For ordinary users, this would mean a H-OTP backup (provided
	it is not on the same/only device as SQRL), for distributed systems or those with stateless considerations, the
	backup might need to be T-OTP, and if your primary concern is the leakage of account credentials from the server,
	RSA is the only clear 'backup' as it does not share any secrets with the server (though it requires a fair degree of
	technical proficiency, compared to the other available options).
