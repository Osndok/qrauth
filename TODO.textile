TODO:
* add user locale db field
* add user email db field
* can the current nuts table be used to verify email addresses?
* maybe: add user unixUid db field (? or start sequence number really high?)
* add tenant, hostname, and ip to nut table
* add shellApiKey (non hashed) to tenant table; UNIQUE
* 'shell' boolean in tenantperson (default false)
* specify, wherever possible, that 'root' user never is authenticated (e.g. listing authorized pubkeys, sync'ing accounts, etc)
* can we get an ever-updating list of all available upstream-packaged-users? or even common system users?
* tenant domain field
* tenant qrauthd connection field ?!?! UNIQUE? domain-restricted?
