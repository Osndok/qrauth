	<p>
	<b>NOTICE:</b> The RSA key that you specified is already in use by <u>a different account</u>. It is possible
	that you have more than one account (possibly one that was pre-provisioned on your behalf), or somebody might
	have errantly added your public key to their account.
	<br/><br/>
	If you would like to claim this public key as your own, please complete the challenge below to prove that
	you are in possession of it's private factor. Doing so will strip the public key from the other account.
	<br/><br/>
	On the other hand, if it is even remotely possible that you already setup an account (or your IT personnel
	may have set one up for you on your behalf), then you should probably try logging in using the private key
	(that matches this public key) before potentially rendering the other account inaccessible.
	</p>

	<br/>
	<b>Challenge:</b>
	<pre>echo -n ${newNutString} | openssl rsautl -sign -inkey ~/.ssh/id_rsa | base64</pre>

	<t:form>
		<t:label for="response"/>
		<t:textarea value="response" t:id="response"/>
		<br/>
		<t:submit/>

		<input type="hidden" name="nut" value="${newNutString}"/>
