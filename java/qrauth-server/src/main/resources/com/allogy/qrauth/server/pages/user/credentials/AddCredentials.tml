		Using a yubikey is a great way to <u>easily</u> and securely authenticate to websites without any
		additional configuration or memorization (as a username is not required). However, if used by itself
		this authentication method earns a low rank due to the fact that (if lost or stolen) anyone could
		use this key at the push of a button. For in-office or at-home use, this may not be an issue, but
		for increased security we reccomend adding a "what you know" factor, such as a username.
		<br/><br/>
		Please activate the Yubikey that you would like to connect with this account in the field below.

<t:block id="staticOtp">
	<t:form t:id="staticOtpForm">
		<b>NOTICE:</b> A static OTP can be a good fallback or account-recovery mechanism, as it earns a much higher
		security rank than general-use passwords due to the fact that they are <b><u>only usable ONCE</u></b>.
		Applications for this method generally include disaster recovery, or granting someone else temporary
		access to an account. As with conventional passwords, a username is required. Unlike passwords (which
		eventually expire), a static one-time-password will (by default) remain effective indefinitely so long
		as it is not used. Also... unlike other OTP mechanisms, this one does not require a special device or
		modile application... therefore, it is somewhat expected that the password will be written down, and
		stowed away securely (such as in a safe or vault).<br/>

		Note that you cannot use a password that has already been used for this account in the past.<br/>

		eventually lose access to your account (if you forget to bless a new password, and your old one expires,
		or if something happens that prevents you from logging in for a while). You will not have any helpful
